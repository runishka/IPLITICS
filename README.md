## Features
- **Player Comparison**: Compare different players based on their statistics.
- **Match Predictions**: Predict IPL match outcomes using statistical analysis and machine learning.
- **Ball-by-Ball Analysis**: Detailed analysis of each ball in a match.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Get real-time updates on matches and player performances.

## Methodology
### Machine Learning (ML) - CRISP-DM
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed dataset for null values and processed data to ensure accuracy.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.
- **Model Accuracy**:
  - **Batsman Demographic**:
    - KNN: 0.9736
    - Linear Regression: 0.9806
    - Random Forest: 0.9757
  - **Bowler Demographic**:
    - KNN: 0.2241
    - Linear Regression: 0.3507
    - Random Forest: 0.3640
